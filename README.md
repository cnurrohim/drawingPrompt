# creature creation station

simple android-flutter app I created while learning
flutter app development.

the premise of this app is simple,
which is generate a drawing prompt for beginner artist
who have difficulty on deciding what to draw.
the prompt is limited by only prompting user to draw a monster.
with basic features, such as: body shape, eyes, limbs, and few extra features.
user can manualy choose what features they like or choose randomly.

this app is made based on brett bean's monster creation station with exact same options.
